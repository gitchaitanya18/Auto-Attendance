# Auto-Attendance
Usually attendance taking at any class is a very tedious and time consuming process, So we tried to automate this process using python and openCV library.


-Firstly use 'build_face_dataset' file to create dataset of desired person's facial images.

-After that 'extract_embedding' and 'train_model' files are used to train openCV's deep learning face recognition model.

-Use 'recognize' file for recognition of input image, and if you want spreadsheet updation use 'recognize2' file.
